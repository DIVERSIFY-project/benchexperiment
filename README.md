# benchexperiment
This are the sources an experiment to validate AutoJMH, a tool we are developing in the team to build Java microbenchmarks automatically.

The idea is to see if AutoJMH is at least as good as a human building microbenchmarks. The results will be used in a paper we hope to submit to ISSTA'16.

Could you please make sure they compile in your machine to save time at the Diverse Coffe? They use JMH as dependency.

If any of you have any experience with JMH please let me know to avoid disparities that could bias the experiment :)

Thank you for your participation!
